# Love Running Project
[Live Webpage](https://arronbeale.github.io/Love-Running/)
---
This is a walkthrough project to create a responsive website for a running club to include locations, times and distances.\
It will demonstrate the use of a hero image and also a zoom animation when you enter the page.
\
\
There will be a gallery page included to demonstrate masonry layout of pictures within the gallery.
\
\
There will not be a sign up page, I will add in the future.
